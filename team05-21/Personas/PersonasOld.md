# Kaho Yau
### Full-time Student, He/Him

## Biography
Kaho is an international student studying Economics at the University of Birmingham. He resides, and is therefore studying remotely in Hong Kong, and although he is fluent in English, many of his international friends and coursemates sometimes struggle with specific concepts in his course due to the language barrier, and he is always keen on being the language mediator - being the person willing to help with translations and explanations whenever he has the chance.

## Personality and Motivations

- Being unable to offer help to other international coursemates who may struggle with understanding the course material
- The lack of a community that international students are offered compared to those able to interact on campus
- Due to timezone differences, he finds it frustrating that he is often unable to participate in group chat discussions live, and often misses out on specific discussions relating to topics he has queries about

## Goals
- A platform for offering translations and further explanations to topics relating to the course to those who may need it
- A centralised hub for keeping tabs on various videos and notes relating to the course, which can be used as reference material during revision
- To be able to connect abroad with other coursemates who are learning similar topics or share common interests and hobbies

# Gigi Joseph-Garrison
### Part-time Student, She/Her

## Biography
Gigi is a part-time student in her first year studying PPE at the Unversity of Birmingham. Gigi has had a unique life, as in 2018 she unexpectedly developed Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/myalgic encephalomyelitis) and had to pull out of her studies at the time. She is studying remotely in London in order to receive adequate medical and family care. Due to her condition, she is bedbound, which severely limits who she can interact with - contrasting sharply with her naturally outgoing and eager attitude.

## Personality and Motivations
- Outgoing and personable, cultivates safe and welcoming friend circles
- Empathetic and provides counselling and support to those also suffering with chronic disease
- Embraces achievements and milestons in her education and recovery, which may lead to disappointments when they are not met

## Frustrations
- As she spends a lot of time recovering and resting, she has very few waking hours to dedicate to her studies
- The lack of understanding by people who dismiss her condition and underestimate her symptoms
- Due to her condition, she often finds it incredibly taxing to interact with devices such as phones or laptops, and often limits it to keyboard interactions with tab navigation

## Goals
- A website with user-accessibility in mind, in order to provide those like her with a more pleasant learning and browsing experience
- To have a platform where she can see curations of videos and discussions about topics created by other coursemates in order to aid her in her limited hours of study
- The ability to raise awareness about her condition by curating her own resources to share with other students
